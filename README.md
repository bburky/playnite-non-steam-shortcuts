# Non-Steam Shortcut Extension for Playnite

This extension will automatically creates non-Steam shortcuts for the currently selected games in Playnite. Multiple games can be highlighted to create multiple shortcuts at once. The game in Playnite will be modified to launch the game using Steam.

Rerunning this extension is safe, it will update the shortcut with the information from the OtherAction titled "Launch without Steam".

Warning: Any existing non-Steam shortcut with the same name (`AppName`) as a game in your Playnite library will be replaced with an updated shortcut. This allows updating shortcuts, but may potentially clobber some of your existing non-Steam shortcuts.

This effectively allows using the Steam overlay for any game in Playnite.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/bburky/playnite-non-steam-shortcuts/archive/master.zip) this extension
2. Extract the extension into a new folder in your "Extensions" folder in your Playnite library.
